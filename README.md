# Applied Population Genetics

This is the content of a textbook I've been working on for a while now.  While I'm refining the text, a task that will continue, I am making it available on my webserver at:

http://dyerlab.github.io/applied_population_genetics/index.html

Any comments or suggestions should be mailed to me at [rjdyer@vcu.edu](mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu).  Additional work from my laboratory can be found at:

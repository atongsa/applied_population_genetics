# Interactive Visualization 

Interpreting complicated networks can be difficult if the number of nodes and/or edges are large, due in large part due to the way we project network structure onto 2-dimensional spaces.  While publication-quality graphics are needed in the end, interpretation can be aided by plotting networks in a dynamic context.  Here we look at a Population Graph constructed using the *Araptus attenuatus* genetic data set.

## Procedure

First, we need to load in the proper libraries. Each of the libraries are needed for:

 - **gstudio** - Contains the *A. attenuatus* data set.  
 - **popgraph** - Performs the `popgraph()` analysis.  
 - **networkD3** - Loads in the javascript D3 library and allows the interactive plot.
